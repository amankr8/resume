Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the [Job Title] position at [Company Name]. As a Software Engineer at Infor, I have been actively involved in the development and enhancement of the Workforce Management Software Application (WFM), contributing to feature implementations, resolving customer-reported issues, and integrating third-party services. My experience with Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Angular, and SQL, along with CI/CD pipeline management using GitLab, has allowed me to deliver high-quality software solutions efficiently.

Prior to my current role, I interned at Samsung Research, where I worked on the MAC sublayer of the 5G NR protocol stack, optimizing load-balancing handovers and improving performance by 27% through a novel algorithm. Additionally, during my tenure as a Business Analyst Intern at Merilytics, I leveraged SQL and Power BI to automate reporting processes, significantly reducing manual effort.

I hold dual degrees—a B.E. (Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and an M.Sc. (Hons.) in Chemistry—from BITS Pilani. Beyond my professional experience, I have developed a web application for an NGO, utilizing Spring Boot and Angular, deploying it on AWS with Docker, and integrating PostgreSQL.

My technical expertise, combined with my problem-solving abilities and experience in software development, makes me an ideal candidate for this role. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to [Company Name] and would welcome the chance to discuss how my background aligns with your team's goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you.

Best regards,

Aman Kumar
